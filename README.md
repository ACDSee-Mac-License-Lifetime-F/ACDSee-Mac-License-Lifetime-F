## Overview

### Efficient Workflow on macOS
ACDSee is a full-featured photo management and editing solution designed for macOS workflows. Its interface organizes cataloging, batch processing, and editing tools to streamline work, whether managing small collections or professional libraries. All operations run locally, reducing reliance on network access.

### Native macOS Integration
The app follows standard macOS conventions for windows, menus, keyboard shortcuts, Finder dialogs, and notifications. This makes it easy to integrate ACDSee into existing workflows alongside other tools.

### Customizable Profiles
ACDSee supports configuration profiles that can be tailored for individual, team, or studio needs. Users can control account management, history retention, project indexing, and refresh frequency. Local processing ensures these settings remain reliable offline.

### Hardware Optimization
The software runs smoothly on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Heavy tasks are managed in the background to maintain a responsive interface. Indexing, syncing, and large project analysis do not interfere with active work.
